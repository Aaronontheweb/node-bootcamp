Ready to learn Node.JS?

Node Bootcamp is a free event (yep, free, thanks to the awesome Microsoft) for developers and designers who want to learn Node.JS from the ground up with hands-on instruction from Node experts at Microsoft and experts from the community. No prior Node experience is necessary to attend.

At Node Bootcamp you'll learn how to build your first Node application from scratch, how to work with popular Node.JS development tools and editors, how to work with popular 3rd party Node frameworks like Express and Socket.IO, and how to deploy your applications to production hosting environments.

We only have capacity for 50 people and we expect this event to fill up fast. Please only RSVP if you know you will be able to attend.

Breakfast, lunch, and snacks will be provided.
