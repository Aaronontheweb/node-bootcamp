# Node Bootcamp

Node Bootcamp is a series of free events aimed at helping new Node.JS developers get from
no Node experience whatsoever to being able to produce their first basic Node applications.

### Event Format

The general format for these events is this:

1. Spend the morning taking some hands-on training from Node.JS experts;
